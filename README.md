# Random-Password-Generator

This project was created through the Scrimba frontend developer path course at www.scrimba.com. 

The languages used throughout this project were HTML, CSS and Javascript. 


**Note: **
This project was completed by myself with minimal referencing to the actual video walkthroughs provided by the Scrimba teacher for this challenge. It tested my knowledge on all three languages mentioned but more specifically, the Document Object Model (DOM) was tested to ensure proper understanding. Overall, I enjoyed breaking down this challenge into smaller chunks and then diving in head first.
